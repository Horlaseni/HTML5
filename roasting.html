<h2>commercial coffee rooster</h2>

<p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans. When roasted the green coffee beans expands to nearly double its the original size changing in colour and density. As the bean absorbs heat, its colour shifts to yellow, then to a light “cinnamon” brown and then to dark brown colour. doing roasting, oils appear on the surface of the bean. The roast will continue to darken on it is removed from the heat source.</p>
<p>Coffee can be roasted with ordinary kitchen equipment (frying pan, grill, oven, popcorn popper) or by specialised appliances. A coffee roaster is a special pan or apparatus suitable to heat up and roast green coffee beans.</p>
<p>The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale but small-scale commercial roasting has grown significantly with the trend toward “single-origin” coffees served as speciality shops. Some coffee drinkers even roast coffee at home as a hobby in order to both experiment with the flavour profile of the beans and ensure themselves of the freshest possible roasts.</p>
