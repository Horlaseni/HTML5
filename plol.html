		steady diet of <strong> TXT or CSV files </strong> and have to go through the process of
		importing them into our Excel solutions before we can start our analysis. For
		us, critical <b>business information</b> is stored in the following formats:
		TXT files, <em>which are delimited by characters</em>
		CSV files, <i>which are delimited by commas</i></p>

		file is fairly straightforward, and follows the basic ETL (extract, transform, and
		load) process, as described in the following sections.

		<blockquote>The download package for this chapter contains two delimited files, either of
		which will work for this example. Both are named Ch01-Delimited, though
		one is a comma-delimited CSV file and the other is a tab-delimited TXT file.
		To import either delimited file using Power Query you can:</blockquote></P>
