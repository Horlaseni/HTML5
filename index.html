<p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. while the particular steps vary 
with the type of coffee and with the materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans
must be roasted, the coffee beans must then be ground, the ground coffee must then be mixed with 
hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be seperated from the used grounds.</p>

<p>Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased 
unprocessed, or already roasted and ground. coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent 
oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.</p>
